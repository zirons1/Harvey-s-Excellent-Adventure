# Harvey's Excellent Adventure

This was an Android app I worked with two other students in the spring of my freshman year.
We were pretty unfamiliar with GitHub at the time and Collin just uploaded the whole thing once we finished.
This was my first experience working on a large software project as part of a team.
The game has three minigames that each of us developed.
I focused on the highscore board for the games as well as all the pixel art for the game.
